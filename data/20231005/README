Issues in B C WASP
No issues in A D X

need more tube for extra bottles
need extra covers (saw ahead of time maybe?)



We will do it in steps to try to see what the problem is
- take the SD card out again, and try it again. Probably the file will be empty again
- put the SD card back inside
- take something metal (like a screw driver or wire, just make sure it conducts electricity :))) and connect the two wires on the back. Connect and disconnect the wires a few times. Maybe one time every 2-3 seconds. Each time it connects it shoud write to the SD card
- take the SD card again and try again and see if it's empty
- if it's still empty, put the SD card back inside
- Look at the battery now, and see if it's connected inside (the spring is not good). See if its maybe backwards. Take it out, and put it back inside
- connect/disconnect the wires again a few times, check the SD card again
- if the file is still empty, then you will need to use the Nightcore charger and check if the battery has any charge/power
