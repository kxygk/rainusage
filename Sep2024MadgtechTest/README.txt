This is the first test of the 4 new Madgtech loggers

All were sealed into glass jars with plastic lids. The lids were sealed on with marine sealant (a kind of soft/flexible glue). There is also an interior layer of protection from the madgtech waterproof box

BLUERED - blue lid, with red wires coming out. This was places outside of the cave

PINK - this was in the first side chamber. This speleothem went crazy and overflooded the attached container. Water somehow penetrated both layers of protection and was inside the waterproof box with the circuit board. The unsoldered terminals also broke off and need to be resoldered!

ORANGE - At LongLizard. This one shows signs of corrosion on the tightening bolt on the waterproof box. But it doesn't look like water made it into the actual case. Will need to be sealed better!

BLUEWHITE - In the Last chamber on the last shelf
