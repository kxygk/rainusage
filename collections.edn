- But `:ThMuCH2WallPole` is also dry..
- Wasp nest is getting huge - couldn't install bottle
For next time:
- Check what's going on at `:C` and `:H`
- Move wasp rain gauge to have a concurrent outside thing (needs bottle and water)
- Why did `:B` start to suddenly work on the 29th?
- water samples need to be mailed to NTU"}

1. Sampler is having weird issues

Nong:
for the matchine, there are some thing happen. if i go early it will turn 1 day less, if i go late it will 1 day over.
Me:
The machine is set to turn in the middle of the night but we do have an issue that when you collect you need to not collect the day it's currently dripping into. But we discussed that
Nong:
time before last time was 8 and then 17

2. The bottle outside had cracked and hadn't been fixed yet
'D is the brocken one out side'
3. Clay to hold lids over the rain gauges in the cave has worn away"}

- inside machine fixed??
- change bottle [B?] location from shelf to ground (easier sample collection - doesn't need to clumb up)

- rain gauge fell due to rat (see pics)"}

- Inside sampler and raingauge (mostly just raingauge..) knocked over by some animal!
- funnel glued to bottom of raingauge also broke off
- 2 days of water had been collected (2 bottles have water)
- 'i   didn't take  photo of  the  memory box'
- 'the toilet paper is    all dry, no     wet at all'
- tube stickers (with unique code) were misplaced.. hence lables come later
In photos you see duplicates, first from cave and then with stickers"}

- NOT GAUGE DATA
- outside no water at all
- Bottle D moved to 'drone place' on rain gauge 6
- inside collected from number 5 to 14
- Nong then tested the machine inside and it's now at position 01
- B and C had no problems
- photo of tubes taken before water collected
- 'There is a bit if a weird thing.. on the 20th we left the machine on number 13.. Maybe there was some left over water'
- Inside and outside on number 1
- 'So you have half the day in number 4 and the second half or the day (after you leave) in number 1'
- 02-04 he went and changed the battery outside sampler
- rain gauge 6 fell over (and someone put it back up?)
